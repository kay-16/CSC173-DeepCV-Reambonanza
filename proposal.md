## 1. Project Title 
Vision-Based Human Fall Detection Using Deep Learning in Philippine Settings

## 2. Problem Statement
The risk and consequences of potential falls increase significantly with age, with people aged 65 years and above are susceptible to serious fall-related injuries that threaten their independence (CDC, 2024). In the Philippines, data from the Online National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (ONEISS) shows that fall is one of the top five leading causes of injury among Filipinos in 2013, 2015, and 2017. To address this concern, this project focuses on developing a deep learning-based fall detection system catered for common environments in the Philippines such as homes, schools, hospitals, barangay centers, and elderly-care facilities. By leveraging standard webcams and video-based models, the system aims to offer a low-cost, non-intrusive, and accessible solution that is timely and revelant, particularly valuable for communities with limited resources across the Philippines. 

## 3. Objectives
